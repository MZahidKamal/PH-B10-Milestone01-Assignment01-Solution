# PH-B10 Milestone 01: Assignment 01 Solution

"This was the assignment for the first milestone of the 10th batch of the Web Development course offered by Programming Hero. Only basic HTML and basic CSS are taught in this milestone, and this small page was created using that.

The page is only designed for large desktop displays. This means it is not responsive, so the design structure may break on smaller displays.

This will remain just as an assignment, and there are no plans to update it."
